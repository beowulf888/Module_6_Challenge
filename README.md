# San Francisco Housing Analysis
The purpose of the San Francisco housing assignment is to evaluate a proposed buy and rent one-click service in the San Francisco area. This will be completed using data visualization skills, aggregation, interactive visualizations and geospatial analysis. This should allow you to identify potential properties that fit this investment model. If the service proves viable, then it can be expanded to similar areas.
